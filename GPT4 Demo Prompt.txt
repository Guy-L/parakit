Hello GPT4! I'm going to run an odd experiment with you; it likely falls outside of what you think you can do, but I'd like you to participate anyways. I'm here to do a quick test run, and then I'll hook you up to my API to see how you perform. You are going to play Touhou 14: Double-Dealing Character on Normal difficulty.

Your objective is to maximize the in-game score, while trying to avoid dying and using your bombs. You're also incentivized to grab power items. Information that will be provided for you: the score, the life count (including life pieces, get 3 for an extra life), your bomb count (get 8 bomb pieces for an extra bomb, dying gives you back three full bombs), your power (out of 4, you get more DPS for every increment of 1 and one power item is 0.01 power), the score value of Point Items, and the total number of bullets you've "grazed" (bullets entering a small circle around you that's bigger than your hitbox; this number going up is a good indicator that danger is near). You will be provided the current coordinates of your player character (the origin of the game environment is in the TOP MIDDLE and it is 368 units wide * 432 units high; for example (184.0, 432.0) is the bottom right corner), the number of invulnerability frames you have if any (non-zero if you die or bomb; the game runs at 60FPS) and whether your movement is focused or un-focused. You will also be provided the list of active enemy bullets (dodge or die), enemies (shoot down to stop them from shooting bullets and drop items; every stage ends with a boss fight which has 1 enemy with lots of health; you can also die by colliding with them), and items (always good to get; mostly Point, Power, Full Power, Life Piece and Bomb Piece).

There are 7 buttons at your disposal: 
1. The SHIFT key, which enables focused movement (more on this later)
2. The Z key, which makes your character shoot (same)
3. Movement to the LEFT
4. Movement to the RIGHT
5. Movement UPWARDS
6. Movement DOWNWARDS
7. The X key, which makes your character bomb (again more on this later).
During the experiment, you will have to format your output as a list of binary strings of length 7, with a bit being set meaning to hold the key, and a bit not being set meaning to release it. For instance, the string "1110100" means "focus, shoot, move up-left, and don't use a bomb". I want you to give me 30 of these strings (separated by spaces), representing the actions you'd like to take over the next 30 frames, in order (first string is first frame's actions, second is the second frame's, etc.). It's critically important that your outputs do not stray from this format.

Most human players make heavy use of the shift key to move with precision and dodge hard attacks. Moving without the shift key is often mostly done during the stage portion which has less bullets and more targets to shoot, though some boss patterns require you to move quickly as well. While you hold the shift key, you move at 5 game units per second, and when you don't, you move at 2 game units per second.

The size of your hurtbox is 1.5 game units around your player position. If the radius of a bullet overlaps with this box, you have died (and will respawn shortly). 
When you hold the shoot button, your character will begin shooting projectiles that go from your current position to the top of the screen and do good damage - this is the "main shot". You also have options that depend on your character, your amount of power and whether or not you are focused. Because you will be playing as MarisaA, holding shoot while unfocused will fire a vertical laser. At 2 power, you get a second vertical laser. At 3 power, you have one vertical laser and two that slightly angled to the left and right. At full power (4), you have two verticals and two slightly angled. Shooting while focused will make fire particles shoot out vertically (called the "flamethrower"). Unless you are very very far from your target vertically (almost the entire screen's height), these particles should mostly hit and do good damage. There are additional particles that shoot out from above you but almost immediately die out; you can make use of them to "shotgun" bosses, aka. do very high damage while up close vertically (not always safe!). As MarisaA, your bomb shoots out a large, damaging laser whose angle follows your movement slowly, which halves your movement speed and makes you invulnerable for about 7 seconds. Bombing makes you grab all items on screen and you cannot use a bomb during a bomb. You can also automatically grab all items on screen by moving your character past a horizontal line near the top of the screen (the "point of collection, under ~70 in-game units).

Here is an example of the input you would get:
```
SCORE: 1840
| 2 lives (0/3 pieces), 3 bombs (0/8 pieces), 1.04 power, 10008 score per point item, grazed bullets 0 total times

• (-146.9, 69.7), 140 / 140
• (148.2, 67.4), 140 / 140
| List of on-screen items:
• Power Item @ (-19.1, 101.2) vel. (-0, -1.7)
• Power Item @ (-32.2, 97) vel. (-0, -1.3)
• Power Item @ (-31.9, 127.5) vel. (-0, -1.2)
• Power Item @ (-32.2, 70.2) vel. (-0, -0.4)
• Power Item @ (-1.5, 62.3) vel. (-0, -0.3)
• Power Item @ (-24.5, 67.6) vel. (0, 0.3)
• Power Item @ (4.6, 61.7) vel. (0, 0.5)
```
For each bullet line, the information is: bullet position, bullet velocity, bullet hitbox radius
For each enemy line, the information is: enemy position, enemy health / max health
For each item line, the information is: item type, item position, item velocity

A Q&A from past interactions with you follows.
Q: Given that the game runs at 60 frames per second, will I be provided with updated game state information every 30 frames (0.5 seconds) to generate a new set of 30 binary strings?
A: Correct! I tried to strike a balance between not giving you enough timely information and limiting the amount of data I send you so as to not run into the GPT4 API usage cap.

Q: Is there any limitation on the number of times I can use the bomb during the game?
A: The number of times you can bomb is linked to your bomb count. Again, collect 8 bomb pieces to get a new bomb, and dying invariably sets your bomb count to 3. When your bomb count is 0, you cannot bomb and must dodge. It's a good idea to keep bombs for more difficult sections, but to also not die with bombs still in stock.

Q: Can I assume that there will be no input errors in the data provided, or should I handle any potential errors in the input?
A: There should not be any input errors in my data, since everything is extracted from the game via a Python script. Due to the way the extraction is done, the data will be all wrong if you are in the main menu or after you've restarted a run, but I will make sure to prevent you from accessing the main menu and restart runs for you and re-set up my extraction each time.

Q: Do you require any kind of reasoning or explanation for my decisions, or is the list of binary strings sufficient?
A: For this initial experiment, after the list of binary actions, I'd like you to briefly explain what you think you're doing, why, and how you expect the game will react. 

Q: Will the provided information include the type of enemy bullets and their movement patterns, or will I have to deduce this based on the bullet velocities provided?
A: The type of a bullet usually doesn't matter as much as its actual hitbox size, which you will be given. Apart from that, yes, you will need to make deductions based on velocities. Most bullets travel linearly; I could extract the information that describes more complex bullet trajectories, but it would be pretty hard for me to do and might confuse you.

Before we begin, do you have any questions or concerns?
